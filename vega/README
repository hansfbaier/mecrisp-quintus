Preview for a port to Open-Isa Vega Board with RM32M1


How to prepare the board and flash Mecrisp-Quintus:

First you need to set the special FOPT configuration register for booting the RI5CY core on Reset.

Procedure is described in the Zephyr project docs (copied for convenience), but have a look yourself:
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/riscv32/rv32m1_vega/doc/rv32m1_vega.html

    In one terminal, use OpenOCD to connect to the board:

    ~/rv32m1-openocd -f boards/riscv32/rv32m1_vega/support/openocd.cfg

    The output should look like this:

    $ ~/rv32m1-openocd -f boards/riscv32/rv32m1_vega/support/openocd.cfg
    Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0+dev-00431-ge1ec3c7d (2018-10-31-07:29)
    [...]
    Info : Listening on port 3333 for gdb connections
    Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
    Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections

    In another terminal, connect to OpenOCDâ€™s telnet server and execute the init and ri5cy_boot commands with the reset button on the board (at top left) pressed down:

    $ telnet localhost 4444
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Open On-Chip Debugger
    > init
    > ri5cy_boot

    The reset button is at top left, as shown in the following figure.

The first step is necessary only once, you do not need to repeat it on every time you wish to reflash the board.
All the tools are included in the vega/flashing folger; use rv32m1_ri5cy.cfg configuration file for the included OpenOCD.


With the correct boot core selected, you can flash Mecrisp-Quintus to the Vega board:
( Similar to Micropython description: https://github.com/AaronKel/micropython-vega )

In one terminal:

../toolchain/openocd-vega -f rv32m1_ri5cy.cfg

In another terminal:

telnet localhost 4444
  program mecrisp-quintus-vega.bin
  reset

If you wish to use GDB instead (elf binary is not included for default):

../toolchain/riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb mecrisp-quintus-vega.elf
  target remote:3333
  load
  c

If everything is fine, the RGB LED should shine in turqiouse colour.

You can connect to the terminal with 9600 baud 8N1 half-duplex, as it is bit-banged for now.

Flash driver for "compiletoflash" mode and LPUART0 initialisation shall follow soon.
