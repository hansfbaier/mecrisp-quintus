This is the first MIPS M4K target of Mecrisp-Quintus.

It runs on the official "PIC32MX1/2/5 Starter Kit" which has no debug terminal
on board and contacts too tiny to reliably solder to.

Therefore, it uses a bit-banged 9600 baud 8N1 over the pins of the push buttons
RD6 (TX) and RD7 (RX) which can be soldered to.

No joy, rather a proof-of-concept.

Feel free to contact me about adding more PIC32 targets !




I am on current stable Debian Linux, you'll get the toolchain with

apt-get install binutils-mipsel-linux-gnu

This should let you recreate the binary image included in the release. The assembler supports larger cores than M4K out of the box.

So far, creating the Mecrisp-Quintus binaries must be doable with FOSS tools.
It's not nice, but I hope it is ok to rely on vendor tools for flashing, if there is no other way.

For flashing, I used "MPLAB Integrated Programming Environment (IPE)" which comes with the MPLAB-X installation.

I am very sorry I found no open source way yet to handle the on-board debugger of my demo board; bare chips can be flashed with a complete FOSS toolchain:
