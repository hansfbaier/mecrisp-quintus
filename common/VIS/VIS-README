VIS-README for Mecrisp-Quintus 0.29 or later                   MM-200820.220814

To add the VIS-Extension with support for VOCs, ITEMs and STICKY Words to
Mecrisp-Quintus please take the following notes into consideration:

1. The VIS-Extension is distributed as a source code file named 

   vis-x.y.z-mecrisp-quintus.fs

2. The VIS-Extension was written for Mecrisp-Quintus 0.27 on a Logan Nano 
   Board with a GD32VF103 MCU. 

   It's known to work well with later Mecrisp-Quintus releases for the GD32
   and it may work with other MCUs but that's not yet tested.

3. The VIS-Extension needs to be installed on a Mecrisp-Quintus core without
   any pre-installed extensions.

   Reset Mecrisp-Quintus with  ERASEFLASH  before loading the VIS-Extension.

4. The VIS-Extension modifies some Mecrisp-Quintus hooks to link the wordlist
   and context switching support into the Mecrisp-Quintus core. This is done
   by a word named INIT.

   Mecrisp-Quintus always executes the last defined INIT on startup or reset.

   So, if you define your own INIT in your code, this INIT must execute the
   last defined INIT to make shure, that all previously defined INITs down 
   to the one of the VIS-Extension are executed. Otherwise the VIS-Extension
   (and maybe other extensions) will fail.

5. From a user perspective there is no difference between the VIS-Extension
   for Mecrisp-Quintus and Mecrisp-Stellaris.

   You can find a VIS Glossary (for Mecrisp-Stellaris) in the Forth-Magazin
   Vierte Dimension 1/2020 and some VIS (Mini) HOWTOs in VD 1/2020 ff.
